                  The time to file your Income Tax for the FY23-24 is nearing
                  with the last date of July 31, 2024. You must be busy sorting
                  out your investments, which you can claim for exemptions, but
                  have you ever thought about what impact your loan has on your
                  income tax? Or whether in any way, the loan amount you
                  borrowed for personal use helps you save taxes. Though this is
                  something less talked about, the impact of personal loans can
                  be significant in your tax planning. In this article, we will
                  find out how your instant personal loan can help you save some
                  taxes this year.

                <strong>
                  Why are personal loans not considered for tax savings?
                </strong>
                &nbsp;
                <p>
                  Before we dig into the ways, you can save taxes with personal
                  loans, let’s understand why these loans are not considered for
                  tax savings usually. So, there are two factors influencing
                  this usual belief. One is the amount of personal loan is
                  usually a nominal amount which does not reflect in your income
                  in a big way. Moreover, as it is a loan, and it has to be
                  repaid in the future, with interest, it is considered a
                  liability. The second factor is that the interest you pay on
                  your personal loan is not eligible for deductions or
                  exemptions under the Income Tax Act, however, there are
                  certain exemptions.
                </p>
                <strong> How to save tax with a personal loan?</strong>
                &nbsp;
                <p>
                  As we were talking about the exceptions, these are the bases
                  of saving taxes with your instant personal loan. There are few
                  instances, where you can avail of deductions and exemptions on
                  your personal loan interest or principal, which can help you
                  save taxes.

                    Buying or constructing residential property: If you are
                    using your personal loan amount to either purchase or
                    renovate your residential house property, then you can claim
                    deductions on your taxable amount up to ₹ 2 lakhs as per
                    Section 24 of the IT Act. However, the owner of the property
                    only can avail of this benefit. Let’s take an example to
                    understand this. Suppose you took a personal loan of ₹ 3
                    lakhs in FY24 and you have invested the same in renovating
                    your house, which is in your name. Now, while filing your
                    ITR for FY24 or AY25, you can claim ₹ 2 lakhs out of the ₹ 3
                    lakhs you availed as a loan for deduction from your total
                    taxable income.

                  <li>
                    For improving/improvising your home: Another way to save
                    your taxes using a personal loan is by using the amount for
                    home improvement. Under section 80C, one can claim
                    deductions up to ₹ 1.5 lakhs for using a personal loan for
                    home improvement. This is in addition to the ₹ 2 lakh limit
                    under section 24.

                  &nbsp;
                  <li>
                    Investing in business: You can also reduce your taxable
                    income using a personal loan, if you use the amount for
                    investing in your business. There is no upper limit to the
                    amount of tax that you can save through this way, however,
                    you can get a significant benefit as your net profits which
                    come under the taxable amount can be reduced using the
                    personal loan. However, you need to provide thorough
                    documentation for the investments you have made using the
                    loan amount and into the kind of businesses. Another thing
                    to keep in mind is that the deduction is available on the
                    amount of interest paid and not the principal amount.

                  <li>
                    Educational purpose: One of the best ways to make use of
                    your personal loan is to invest the same for higher
                    education for yourself, or spouse, or your children. You can
                    claim a deduction for availing of this loan for eight years
                    or until the amount is repaid completely.
                  </li>
                  &nbsp;
                  <li>
                    Purchase of Assets: If you use a personal loan for
                    purchasing any asset such as gold, stocks, non-residential
                    properties, and others then you can claim a deduction on the
                    interest amount you pay on the loan and it can be included
                    in the cost of acquisition of the assets. This can help you
                    reduce your capital gains and thus your tax liabilities.

                <strong>Conclusion</strong>
                &nbsp;
                <p>
                  While personal loans are known for their easy availability and
                  flexible application procedure, repayment tenure, often the
                  tax benefits are ignored. However, if these loans are used
                  wisely, they can not only help you grow but also help you save
                  a lot of taxes.

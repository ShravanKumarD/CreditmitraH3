      <h2>What is a Good CIBIL Score?</h2>
      <p>
        CIBIL score ranges from 300 to 900 points and it is at the discretion of the lender to determine whether you have a good, bad, poor, or excellent score. However, in general, CIBIL score ratings look like this:
      </p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Score</th>
            <th>Rating</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>300-500</td>
            <td>Poor</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>550-650</td>
            <td>Average</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>650-750</td>
            <td>Good</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>750-900</td>
            <td>Excellent</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
        While many lending institutions consider a CIBIL score above 700 or 750 to be good, CIBIL itself rates its score as given in the table above.

      <h2>How to Improve Your CIBIL Score?</h2>
      <p>
        Improving your CIBIL score is not rocket science and anyone with little diligence and patience can improve their score for availing instant personal loans easily. Here are the eight tips for improving your CIBIL score:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>1. Reduce your Credit Utilization:</strong>
          The first and one of the most important tips that you can keep in mind is regarding credit utilization. Suppose you are getting approval for ₹ 50000 as an instant loan but you have a requirement of only ₹ 20000. So, if you just avail the entire amount that is approved, it will decrease your CIBIL as the credit utilization ratio will be 100%. So, make sure you never utilize the entire amount available or anything beyond your actual requirement.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2. Timely Repayments:</strong>
          This tip is very common but the crux of improving the CIBIL score. Timely repayment will not only improve your CIBIL score drastically but also save you harassment by the lender, or collection agents. You can set reminders for making the repayments, or the best thing is to set up an automatic payment option.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>3. Limit your loan applications:</strong>
          Often people in the hurry of availing instant personal loans apply for multiple loans with different lenders. Every loan application generates a hard inquiry, which affects your CIBIL score. If the loan application is being rejected, it can have an adverse impact on the score. So, if you are looking to improve your score, slow down, and stop applying for loans now and then.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>4. Keep track of your CIBIL score:</strong>
          Prevention is better than cure, isn’t it? So, keeping track of your CIBIL score will not only help you understand the effect of your repayments, credit utilization, and applications but also help you improve your score as you can take immediate action if there is a drop in the score.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>5. Longer Credit History:</strong>
          A person with a longer credit history has a higher chance of a better credit score, provided he or she has made timely repayments and used credit wisely. A long credit history helps minimize the adverse effects of missing EMIs, or over-credit utilization. For instance, if you have a yearlong credit history, where you have taken two loans, and defaulted in one, and on the other hand, a person with five years of credit history, where he has taken ten loans and defaulted in just two of them, will have a better CIBIL than yours.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>6. Negotiations:</strong>
          If you are having a problem repaying the loan, you can negotiate it with the lender to ease the terms or increase the tenure, so that the EMIs decrease and you can pay easily. This way you can improve or maintain your credit score.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>7. Avail different types of credit:</strong>
          If you are looking for a loan for personal use, then you can mix credit from credit cards, instant loans, and personal loans from banks, and you can avail loans against collateral this way you can maintain a good mix of credit which also helps in improving credit score.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>8. Professional Help:</strong>
          Finally, if you are not sure how to improve your credit score, you can get help from professionals. It is better when you are looking for a significant instant personal loan amount to avail and you need to improve your score for the same.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>

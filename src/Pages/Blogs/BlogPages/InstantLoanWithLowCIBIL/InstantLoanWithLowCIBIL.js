        <strong> What Is CIBIL Score? </strong>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CIBIL score is the credit score that is generated taking into account
        your credit history and its length, repayment history, credit
        utilization, and also the type of credits availed. The score ranges
        between 300 to 900, where a score above 750 is considered a good score.
        Any score below 600 is usually considered poor or low CIBIL score
        however, it also varies from lender to lender.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Since unsecured loan providers take no collateral on which they can fall
        back if the borrower does not repay the loan amount, they prioritize
        better credit scores or CIBIL scores to check the credibility of the
        borrower.

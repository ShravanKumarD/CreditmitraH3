      How much it makes you happy when you get your favorite piece of clothing at a price, which you bargained for? A lot, isn’t it? It can make your day, right? However, the amount you save is a one-time saving, isn’t it? Now think what if your one-time negotiation helps you save money every month? Yes, that’s what happens when you negotiate your personal loan interest rates. When you avail a loan at a lower interest rate, it helps you save on the whole amount of interest that is payable. Even a nominal decrease in the interest rate can do wonders. However, the question is how to negotiate. So, this article will talk about ten such ways in which you can crack a better deal with your personal loan lender and reduce the interest rate on your loan. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
        	Take time to pick your lender: There are hundreds of lenders offering instant personal loans. However, only a handful of them charge reasonable interest rates doe instant CreditMitra. It charges a very nominal interest rate on its loans. So, check different lenders, compare their offers, shortlist a few of them, and then see and compare which lender is offering the lowest rate without compromising on the facilities. You should also check the loan duration, repayment terms, penalty charges, and other factors while picking your lender. 
        </li>
      
        &nbsp;
      
        <li>
        	Credit score is the game changer: After picking the right lender, for negotiating lower interest rates, you need a good credit score. While personal loans are available for people with lower credit scores too, they may not get ample opportunity to negotiate better interest rates. So, make sure you have been paying your loan EMIs on time, haven’t used up all your credit limit, and do not enquire about loans frequently, as all these affect your credit score. The higher the credit score you have, the better negotiation you can do and the lowest interest rate you can get. 
        </li>
        
        &nbsp;
            <li>
      	Financial stability: Apart from credit score, the financial stability and income of an applicant also matter when it comes to negotiating better interest rates on personal loans. The more stable income you have, especially if you are salaried, you can get better rates as the income is not uncertain and the lender can be assured that they will get timely repayments via EMIs. So, to avail of better interest rates, all you need to do is establish your financial stability in front of the lender. 
      </li>
      
        &nbsp;
    
      <li>
      	Choose a short tenure: Often personal loans of short tenure come with lower interest rates. So, if you can shorten your repayment tenure for the loan, you can be in a position to negotiate better with the lender to lower the interest rates. However, do not choose any tenure that is not feasible for your income level and financial standing. 
      </li>
  
        &nbsp;
    
      <li>
      	Go for lenders you know: If you already know the lender, from whom you have earlier availed loans, the chances of getting better offers from them increases. So, you should choose them, however, if you have your credit score in place, with financial stability, you can get better offers from new lenders as well. 
      </li>
    
        &nbsp;
    
      <li>
      	Check pre-approved offers: Pre-approved personal loans have a lower interest rate usually compared to the ones you are applying for yourself. Also, you will be in a better place to negotiate with the lender who is offering you pre-approved loans. Check with the lenders who are offering pre-approved loans, and compare their offers. 
      </li>
    
        &nbsp;
      
      <li>
      	Find special offers on personal loans: Often lenders offer different discounts on personal loans. Keep an eye on these offers and you may get a great deal on loans where the interest rates can be lowered.  
      </li>
            &nbsp;
      
      <li>
      	Offer collateral: If you are going for a higher amount, it is always better to offer collateral so that the interest rate can decrease and thus the amount of interest payable. You can discuss with your lender and see what kind of collateral they accept. This will also strengthen your loan application and negation power. 
      </li>
    
        &nbsp;
      
      <li>
      	Apply with a co-borrower: Similarly, when you apply with a co-borrower, the risk of the lender is reduced and thus they can offer you a better interest rate. However, your co-borrower needs to be eligible and have a good credit score and financial stability.
      </li>
    
        &nbsp;
    
      <li>
      	Confidence is the key: Finally, confidence in yourself is the key when you are negotiating. Make sure you have a solid profile and negotiate with confidence. Do not fear rejection from the lender. When you have clear intentions and a good profile, you will get other lenders and better offers as well.

      With the advent of new-age financial services, availing of instant personal loans is super easy. However, as a borrower, you must consider that any loan is a financial liability, which you need to repay. While these loans can be helpful during a financial crunch, only if you avail them with a clean intention, then only you can avail them in the future as well. It has been observed that many people avail of these loans and then do not repay the amount, which leads to various consequences.       </p>
       <p className={pClass}>
      So, before you avail your next Instant personal loans make sure you have the correct intention, you are aware of the recovery process followed by the lenders to recover the loan they have disbursed, and guidelines set by RBI in regards to the same. 
      </p>
      <h2>What does loan recovery mean?</h2>
       <p className={pClass}>
      When you avail a personal loan, there is a repayment tenure within which you have to repay the entire loan amount. The full amount includes the principal you have borrowed, the interest incurred on the same, and any processing fee or any other compliance fee if included in the amount. 
      </p>
       <p className={pClass}>
      Now this total amount is divided into monthly installments, which are known as EMIs. The borrower must repay the EMIs within the due dates. If anyone fails to do so, then the lender has the right to recover the loan by different means as directed by the RBI and other financial authorities, which will be discussed below. </p>
      <h2>How do lenders recover personal loans?</h2>
       <p className={pClass}>
      The recovery process for Instant personal loans depends on the cause of default and the approach made by the borrower. Broadly speaking, there are two ways opted by the lenders to recover loans. 
      </p>
      <ul className={ulClass}>
        <li className={liClass}>
          <strong>1.	Non-judicial Method:</strong>
         The first method or the initial method is the non-judicial method where in the beginning, the lender makes phone calls to the borrower and asks them to make the repayment, or sends them notifications and messages or mail. At this stage, the penalty charges start being added to the loan, which also needs to be repaid along with the installment due. The lender can also send physical letters to repay the loan EMI but if the borrower does not respond to any of these, then it can send its recovery agents to the registered address of the borrower.</li>
        <li className={liClass}>
          <strong>2.	Judicial Method: </strong>
         If none of the non-judicial methods works, then the lender can take a judicial step where it can approach the court and via court send notice to the borrower to repay the amount borrowed/due within a stipulated period failing to which, the borrower can be summoned by the court. </li>
        
      </ul>
     <h2>Examples:</h2>
      <p className={pClass}>
     Let's understand the loan recovery process with these examples. 
Suppose, Rahul has a stable income from his job and a great credit score, so he borrowed a personal loan for renovating his house. However, due to a sudden layoff, Rahul lost his job and started missing his EMIs. 
     </p>
     <p className={pClass}>
    In such a scenario, where the intention of the borrower is clean and due to genuine financial difficulties, he cannot repay the loan, the lender can offer him some options such as – 
    </p>
    <li className={liClass}>
    	Extension of repayment tenure where the EMIs are lowered as the number of months is increased. This can help Rahul pay off the loan slowly but steadily. 
    </li>
    <li className={liClass}>
     Reduction in the amount due so that Rahul has to pay a lower amount which he can afford. 
    </li>
    <li className={liClass}>
    The lender can also pause the EMIs for a while in certain cases like this where the income source of the borrower has been drastically affected. This is known as increasing the moratorium of the loan, which happened during the pandemic.
    </li>
     <p className={pClass}>
    However, there is one thing Rahul has to consider choosing a ‘haircut’ or moratorium solution can negatively affect his credit score. 
    </p>
     <p className={pClass}>
    The credit score plays an important role in the loan recovery process too. As Rahul had a great credit score, he was offered moratorium and ‘haircut’ options, however, people who have availed of instant personal loans with lower credit scores, may not get these options. 
    </p>
    <h2>
    Guidelines of RBI regarding Loan Recovery
    </h2>
     <p className={pClass}>
    Since earlier private lenders and even certain banks used to harass borrowers for the loan recovery process, RBI, the Central Bank of the country, has set certain guidelines for the process that every lender has to follow. Here are the guidelines and as a borrower, you should be aware of them too to know your rights and duties. 
    </p>
    <li className={liClass}>
    	The lender must send legal notice to the borrower for the default in case the borrower has failed to make the repayments within due time. 
    </li>
    <li className={liClass}>
    	The lenders must adhere to the Fair Practice Code set by RBI. 
    </li>
    <li className={liClass}>The lender cannot threaten or harass the borrower to recover the money. Lenders cannot give physical or mental threats to the borrowers.</li>
    <li className={liClass}>Every Recovery agent must adhere to the RBI’s Code of Conduct during the loan recovery process. They are not permitted to use any filthy language or threats and of course no physical violence. </li>
    <li className={liClass}>Lenders must offer a structured settlement process to the borrower to help him repay the amount due and close the loan.</li>
    <li className={liClass}>The borrowers also have the legal right to take action if they feel their rights have been violated. </li>
   <h2>Wrapping Up:</h2>
    <p className={pClass}>Instant personal loans are like boons but you must be responsible while availing them. Knowing the guidelines of RBI and the loan recovery process is crucial for every borrower so that they know their obligations, rights, and the process they have to go through if they fail to repay the loan.</p>

        Instant personal loans can be a savior in times of
        crisis and emergencies, however, you need to know what &lsquo;NOT TO
        DO&rsquo; while applying for these loans. Often people applying for
        these loans get their application rejected for these mistakes. For you
        to avail of personal loans easily without any hassle
        here are eight mistakes that people commonly make while applying for the
        loan, which you can avoid.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Not Borrowing the Required Amount:</strong> Often it has been
          observed that while applying for{" "}
          instant personal loans, if the limit of credit is
          higher the applicant opts for the higher limit. For instance, suppose
          you are getting a credit limit of ₹ 50000 but you only require ₹
          20000. So, applying for ₹ 20000 can increase the chances of getting
          the approval rather than applying for the entire amount of credit
          available. In addition, at times, people apply for loan amounts higher
          than they require and this leads to the rejection of their application
          due to a mismatch of income and other parameters and the applied loan
          amount. So, to increase your chances of getting the loan, you must
          decide the amount you need, and only apply for the same.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ignoring Credit Score:</strong> While{" "}
          instant personal loans are available for people with
          low or poor credit scores while applying for a loan, it is important
          to consider the credit score. If you have a lower credit score, and
          you apply for a higher loan amount, most chances, it will get
          rejected. So, it is always better to apply for smaller amounts of
          loans, repay them on time, and rebuild your credit score so that in
          the future you can apply for higher amounts when required. Ignoring
          your credit score and applying for a higher amount can further dampen
          your credit score due to a failed loan inquiry.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ignoring penalties:</strong>
          Instant personal loans come in handy but when you
          fail to repay the EMIs on time, the penalties can accumulate and the
          amount of debt can increase significantly. Often people take personal
          loans without planning how to repay them. This leads to repayment
          issues, which degrades the credit score of the borrower and can lead
          to legal charges too if dues are not cleared within a stipulated
          period. Talking about penalties, one must also check the penalty for
          prepayment of a loan. Often lenders charge a penalty for prepaying the
          remaining loan amount. You need to compare whether the penalty is
          lower than the interest you will have to pay for the loan tenure or
          higher. If lower, then it makes sense to repay the loan earlier and
          reduce your financial burden, however, if you have to pay a hefty
          penalty for repaying the loan before the tenure then it does not make
          any sense as such.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Neglecting Eligibility Criteria:</strong> One of the most
          common mistakes that people make while applying for{" "}
          personal loans is not checking the eligibility
          criteria. Every lender has different eligibility criteria, some offer
          loans to salaried people only, while others offer to self-employed and
          students as well. The minimum income criteria differ across lenders,
          and so is the age criterion, and others. So, you need to check and see
          whether you fulfill the eligibility criteria of the lender with whom
          you are applying for the loan. Often loan applications are rejected
          due to non-compliance with the eligibility criteria.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Not choosing the right loan tenure:</strong> Similar to loan
          amount, loan tenure also plays an important role in the approval of
          your loan application. If you choose a very lengthy loan tenure, then
          it can increase the interest rate as well as the interest amount that
          you will be paying to the lender. Always determine the loan tenure as
          per your repayment abilities, and be neither aggressive nor lenient.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Neglecting Different Lenders Offers:</strong> When you avail
          of instant personal loans, you must check offers from different
          lenders. Often one of the major mistakes that people make is not
          checking different lenders. When you check different lenders, and
          their loan options for you, you can pick the most suitable one. It can
          also give you the upper hand as you can negotiate terms with your
          lender and settle for the best offer.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ignoring the Fine Print: </strong>Most people while signing
          the loan agreement ignore the fine print. You must read the agreement
          so that you know the exact interest rate, tenure, and other charges
          that are levied. If you miss any important detail, it can cost you a
          lot. For instance, if you miss the penalty charges for prepayment,
          while you have planned for prepaying the loan within a few months, you
          can incur losses, or create a debt burden for yourself.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Making multiple inquiries:</strong> One of the biggest
          mistakes that people make while applying for personal loans is enquiring with multiple lenders.
          This affects the credit score and future credibility of the lender.
          You must compare different lenders, and their offers, then shortlist
          2-3 from them, and apply with a single lender at a time. Only if the
          application is rejected, then go for the next one.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        With the evolution in the instant personal loans space,
        availing short-term personal loans during your need is
        no more a daunting task, if you can avoid these mistakes and apply
        wisely for the loan.

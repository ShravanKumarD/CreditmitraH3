        </li>

        <strong>Cons</strong>

        <strong>What is a Credit Card Loan?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A credit card loan can be defined as the amount you use from your credit
        card limit to pay for different purchases and bills. Credit cards are
        generally used for day-to-day transactions as well unlike personal loans
        to finance something crucial. It is a physical card like your ATM or
        Debit Card, and you have a limit for instance, say monthly ₹ 1 lakh.
        Therefore, you can use your credit card for transacting up to ₹ 1 lakh
        in a month.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, the repayment of credit card dues is every month. This means, the
        amount you use in a month, has to be paid by the next month or the due
        date as mentioned in the clauses. You can choose to pay the
        &lsquo;minimum amount&rsquo; but the remaining amount is converted into
        debt and it starts incurring interest on the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, you used ₹ 50000 in April 2024 out of your credit card,
        and in the next billing cycle, you only paid ₹ 10000, so, after the due
        date, interest will be charged on the remaining ₹ 40000, which is due.
